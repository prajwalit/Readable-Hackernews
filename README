Readable HN.

HackerNews' font is too small and header color is too flashy for my taste.
I fixed it with this extension.

Its not on extension library right now, so to use it now:
Download readable-hn.crx file and drag-drop it in chrome.

OR

1) Clone Repository. 
2) Go to Chrome extension tab and switch on the developer mode.
3) click on load unpacked extension and select readable-hn folder.

If there are any issues with this extension, contact me - contact [at] prajwalit [dot] com
